- Edge case considerations - You asked great clarifying questions around the input types such as the number of arguments and value of arguments.

- Technical communication - overall, you did a great job using technical communication and referring to elements properly, using terms like arguments, parameters, and callback functions. I clearly understood what you were doing when working through your solution.

- Pseudocode and preparation - You did a great job of reading through the prompt and clearly understanding it before moving on. You added pseudocode before starting to code out your solution, which clearly helped you navigate through the solution more easily.

- Pseudocode & Testing - your pseudocode was very descriptive for every solution and made it easy for me to follow along. You also always tested and console logged without being prompted, which is very good practice

- Debugging - there were multiple times where you have encountered bugs in your code and you quickly resolved the issue by utilizing the error messages that came back

- Efficient Code - You avoided declaring unnecessary variables, extra looping, and additional conditional statements

- Thinking out loud - I never had a hard time following your solution, when you switched methods or approaches, you were very clear on what you were doing and how you were going to approach this new strategy

- Thinking out loud - great work verbally communicating your overall strategy and thoughts

- Edge Case & Testing - Thought about edge cases (if 0 is even or odd) in your negativeOrEven problem and was thorough in testing your approach 

- Error Message - Great job on looking up error messages and tackling blocks 

- Identifying type of problem - You were able to identify the problem being a callback-type problem

- Syntax & Formatting - organization and formatting made your code easy to follow.

-JS Fundamentals - strong JS fundamentals, understanding of higher order functions, helper functions, and JS Methods

- Online resources - great job using the internet to find an answer to your question. Knowing how to be an effective researcher is paramount. 

- Struggling through blocks - even though you got stuck, you remained committed to solving the problem and used all your resources to do that. 

# Feedback: Area for improvement
- Understanding the prompt - read through the prompt carefully and ask any clarifying questions before starting your pseudocoding -- on checkerLogger & countChar, a bit of time was lost because of misinterpreting the prompt 

- JavaScript topics - take some time to brush up on alternatives to approaches when JS native methods/loops cannot be used 

- Syntax/Typo - be cautious of syntax errors and typos. Use the IDE (CS Bin) to your advantage! It changes colors for specific syntax (e.g. function, log, let) and can save you time debugging

- Syntax errors - There were a few instances where you were missing curly braces or paren's. Whenever you get an error that may be pointing to this, be sure to walk through the code to isolate where you're missing a brace or bracket.

- Recursion - Keep practicing those recursion problems, while your solution worked for subsetSum, it is possible to be more efficient by using recursion and writing less code.

- Simplify solution - There were a couple times where you overcomplicated the solution by creating unnecessary variables or arrays. Just keep in mind the native js methods you have in your toolbox, and that every variable should serve an individual purpose.

- Communication - While you effectively communicated your approach, there were a number of times, especially upon hitting errors, that you became very quiet, so I couldn't tell where you were stuck. Practicing pair programming a little more will help you with that!

- Const vs. Let - A few times when declaring functions, object or arrays, you used 'let' instead of 'const,' even when you never reassigned those variables.

- Const/let - usually for best practice, we would define any composite data types using 'const' keyword instead of 'let' as the data type will not change

- Recursion Terminology - While you seemed to have a solid understanding of how recursion works, you struggled to explain the components of a recursive function with the correct terminology. 

- Approach - you changed your approach several times, thus leading to time lost. Would recommend for you to try it through with your initial approach and debug from there. 

- JS Higher-Order Function - great job on utilizing the .forEach method, but take some time on brushing up .reduce and any other higher-order functions

- Technical Communication - remember to constantly communicate to the interviewer, there were moments of silence when pseudo/actual coding. Recommendation: when practicing, record yourself technically communicating a problem out

- Spread Syntax - great job on using the rest parameter when having an unknown number of arguments, but brush up on the spread syntax

- Overall Approach - be sure to be vocal of your overall high level approach before actually coding to ensure everyone is on the same page as your thought process

- Pseudocode - Even if the problem is simple, make sure to fully pseudocode out your thought process. This helps not only you understand your thought process if you come back to the problem, but helps your pair programming partner understand better as well. 

- Debugging - Utilize console.logs in order to debug your code if you're unsure of what is causing your error 

- JS Fundamentals - continue to build your foundation of javascript fundamentals, proper use of for loops and if statements, and javascript methods in order to grow your confidence and problem solving skills.

-Improving research skills - understanding how to google and what to search are very important skills to have when it comes to solving problems. There was a time during passAllTests when you got a little stuck but didn't know what to search and went down a path that was the wrong direction which took away time from solving the problem or finding the right direction to go.

- Advanced Javascript Topics - Consider reading up on advanced JavaScript to learn more about what's happening under the hood in terms of memory, additional data types outside of the most common primitive and composite data types.

- Advanced Javascript Topics - Consider reading up on advanced JavaScript around ES6 to learn about more efficient ways to write code.  String template literals and spread operators are a fun place to start!

- Technical Communication - there were a few times when terms like 'test case' and 'base case' or 'parameter' and 'argument' were used interchangeably. Be sure to speak slowly and use the appropriate term.  Also consider reading into ES6 terminology such as ternary operator instead of using phrases like 'one line if statement'.

- Code Efficiency - while majority of your code was optimized, there were a few places (like minAndMax and passAllTests) where your solution declared variables unnecessarily.

- Debugging - while you often considered the error output in your debugging process, it's important to conduct thorough investigate before immediately refactoring.  This was especially true when debugging the add function.

- Equality Checks - due to Javascript being a weakly typed language, it's preferred to use strict equality checks (===) whenever possible to prevent unexpected behavior.

- Formatting - Be mindful of indentation and semicolons.  While JS is quite forgiving, adhering to best practices is helpful when debugging or pair programming.

- Data Types - consider doing further research on various properties of JavaScript data types. In largestSwap, instead of using logic, you also could have converted the number to a string and indexed into it, which may have reduced the overall amount of code.

- Communication - while your technical communication was detailed and thorough, at certain points it was more granular than needed.  Be sure to gauge the ability of your audience and communicate at an appropriate level.

- Clarifying questions - while you did ask some clarifying questions, get in the practice of doing this for each question. Even if you think you fully understand the prompt, just ask to make sure.
